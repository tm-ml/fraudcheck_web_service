                <p class="lead">With a strong background in the automotive and insurance industries, I have spent years
                    mastering data analysis, negotiations, and technical assessments. Throughout my career, I have
                    worked with people from various backgrounds, helping them navigate complex technical and financial
                    matters with clarity and efficiency.</p>
                <p class="lead-01">Driven by my passion for data-driven decision-making, I am currently transitioning into
                    the field of Data Science. Over the past two years, I have been actively learning and teaching
                    practical applications of Python for data analysis, machine learning, and automation. My expertise
                    includes working with NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-Learn, XGBoost, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, as well as
                    FastAPI, Flask, Web Scraping (Beautiful Soup, Selenium), SQL, Excel (including Power Query), and
                    front-end technologies (HTML, CSS, Bootstrap).</p>
                <p class="lead">Combining my technical acumen with problem-solving and analytical thinking, I aim to
                    leverage Data Science to optimize business processes, detect patterns, and drive insights. I am
                    eager to bring my expertise and unique perspective to a dynamic, data-driven team.</p>
