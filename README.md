## Getting Started

### How It Works
User submits form data in multiple steps.
Data is stored in a relational SQLite database.
Once all forms are submitted, the app aggregates the data.
A JSON payload is sent to a prediction API.
The API responds with a fraud risk prediction.
The result is shown to the user and saved in the database.

### Database View
Use the /database route to view all submitted requests and prediction results in table format.
